## Instructions
All test code can be run from the empirical.py file

### Empirical Study
* C increases by nearly a factor of 8 between the nested for loops and the 4 part recursive call solution. This is due to the overhead generated by the recursion
* The empirical result was not as close to the cook book numbers as I would have expected but this may be due to the random sampling of that particular run or be due to the relatively small sample size


### Notes

* the textbook meathod stood up fairly well to our naive attempts at algorithms but quickly fell off when compared to the clever algorithm
